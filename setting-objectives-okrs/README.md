# Setting Objectives & OKRs

Guide teams and individuals through setting Objectives, Key Results (OKRs), and annual goals that translate strategy into measurable execution — with concrete templates, examples, and quality checks that keep you out of the “vague OKR” trap.

This skill is designed to be **practical for real teams**, not just theory:
- **End‑to‑end workflow** from drafting Objectives through cascading to individual goals and manager reflection.
- **FROM → TO metrics everywhere** so goals are measurable and auditable, not vibes.
- **Built‑in quality rubrics and examples** (including discovery OKRs and manager reflections) so you can quickly spot and fix weak OKRs.
- **Clear “when to use / when not to use” guidance**, so the agent only reaches for this when OKRs and goal‑setting are actually the right tool.

Use it when you want to turn strategy into execution with a small set of sharp, outcome‑driven OKRs instead of long wishlists or task backlogs.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add razzza/skills-management-setting-okr-goals
```

## Why this skill is great

- **Outcome‑first, not task‑first**: pushes Objectives and Key Results that describe real change in the business or team, with initiatives explicitly separated.
- **Ready for managers and ICs**: includes specific patterns for business, people, and personal development goals, plus how to cascade from team KRs.
- **Defensive by design**: calls out failure patterns (task‑based KRs, sandbagging, misaligned goals, orphan work) and gives concrete fixes.
- **Production‑ready structure**: comes with references, examples, and templates you can plug directly into planning docs, goal systems, or 1:1s.
