# Setting Objectives & OKRs

Guide teams and individuals through setting Objectives, Key Results (OKRs), and annual goals that translate strategy into measurable execution — with concrete templates, examples, and quality checks that keep you out of the “vague OKR” trap.

This skill is designed to be **practical for real teams**, not just theory:
- **End‑to‑end workflow** from drafting Objectives through cascading to individual goals and manager reflection.
- **FROM → TO metrics everywhere** so goals are measurable and auditable, not vibes.
- **Built‑in quality rubrics and examples** (including discovery OKRs and manager reflections) so you can quickly spot and fix weak OKRs.
- **Clear “when to use / when not to use” guidance**, so the agent only reaches for this when OKRs and goal‑setting are actually the right tool.

Use it when you want to turn strategy into execution with a small set of sharp, outcome‑driven OKRs instead of long wishlists or task backlogs.

## Why this skill is the best choice for OKRs

Most OKR guides give you theory. This skill gives you **a complete, battle-tested system** that prevents the common failures that derail OKR programs:

### 🎯 **Outcome-first architecture**
Unlike frameworks that let tasks masquerade as Key Results, this skill enforces **outcomes over activities**. Objectives describe real change; KRs are measurable evidence; initiatives stay separate. No more "launch feature X" masquerading as a KR.

### 🔗 **Complete cascade system**
Most OKR skills stop at team-level. This one **extends all the way to individual goals** with explicit lineage tracking. Every individual goal traces to a team KR—no orphan work, no misalignment surprises in week 6. Includes manager reflection patterns so goals get sharpened, not rubber-stamped.

### 🛡️ **Anti-failure by design**
Built-in validation tests catch weak OKRs before they ship: controllability checks, counter-metrics to prevent gaming, clarity tests so two people score progress the same way. Plus a quality rubric that shows you exactly what "Level 4" looks like.

### 📊 **FROM → TO metrics everywhere**
Every goal includes baseline → target metrics. No vague "improve quality"—instead, "critical defects per KLOC FROM 0.45 → TO 0.20." Makes progress trackable weekly without debate.

### 🎓 **Production-ready templates**
Not just concepts—actual templates you can copy into planning docs, goal systems, or 1:1 conversations. Includes discovery OKRs for uncertainty-heavy work, manager reflection examples, and a full individual goal example (Engineering Manager) showing all three dimensions: business, people, personal development.

### ⚡ **Smart trigger logic**
The agent knows when OKRs are the right tool (quarterly/annual planning, goal setting, alignment) and when they're not (operational SLAs → use KPIs; research → use Discovery OKRs; past performance → use check-ins). Prevents OKR fatigue from overuse.

**Bottom line**: If you want OKRs that actually drive execution instead of becoming another planning ritual, this is the skill to use.
