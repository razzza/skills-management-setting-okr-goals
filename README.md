# skills-management-setting-okr-goals

Guide teams and individuals through setting Objectives, Key Results (OKRs), and annual goals that translate strategy into measurable execution.

This repository contains the `setting-objectives-okrs` skill for the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) Agent Skills Directory. It helps agents lead humans through:
- Defining a small set of sharp Objectives and outcome‑based Key Results.
- Adding baselines, targets, and counter‑metrics so OKRs are measurable and anti‑gaming.
- Cascading team KRs into individual goals across business, people, and personal development.
- Running manager reflections that confirm alignment and sharpen goals.

The skill is opinionated toward **focus, measurability, and alignment**, and comes with references, templates, and examples to make OKRs actually usable in day‑to‑day planning and performance conversations.
